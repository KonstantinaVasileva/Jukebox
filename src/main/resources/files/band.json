    "description": "The Everly Brothers were an American rock duo, known for steel-string acoustic guitar playing and close harmony singing. Consisting of Isaac Donald \"Don\" Everly and Phillip \"Phil\" Everly, the duo combined elements of rock and roll, country, and pop, becoming pioneers of country rock.\n\nDon and Phil Everly were raised in a musical family. As children in the 1940s, they appeared on radio in Iowa singing with their parents as \"The Everly Family\". During their high school years in Knoxville, they performed on radio and television. The brothers gained the attention of Chet Atkins, who began to promote them. They began writing and recording their own music in 1956. The brothers' first hit song was \"Bye Bye Love,\" which hit No. 1 in the spring of 1957. Additional hits, including \"Wake Up Little Susie,\" \"All I Have to Do Is Dream,\" and \"Problems\", would follow through 1958. In 1960, they signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded \"Cathy's Clown,\" which was their biggest-selling single. The brothers enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in 1961 and their output dropped off, though additional hit singles continued through 1962. Their final top 10 hit was \"That's Old Fashioned (That's the Way Love Should Be)\".",
